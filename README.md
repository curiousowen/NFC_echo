NFC_echo : A Python tool for capturing and replaying NFC data from devices like bank cards for security analysis.

NFC_echo: A Python Tool for NFC Sniffing and Replaying
Introduction

NFC_echo is a Python tool designed to capture and replay data from NFC (Near Field Communication) devices. This tool is particularly useful for security researchers and enthusiasts who want to analyze the data exchanged by NFC-enabled bank cards and other similar devices. NFC_echo leverages the nfcpy library to interact with NFC hardware, making it simple to sniff and replay NFC communications.

Features

    Sniffing: Capture data from NFC devices, such as bank cards.
    Replaying: Replay the captured data to simulate the original NFC device.

Prerequisites

    Python: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
    nfcpy: Install the nfcpy library, which is used for NFC communication.

Choose an Option:

    1. Sniff: Capture data from an NFC bank card.
    2. Replay: Replay the captured data.
    3. Exit: Exit the tool.

Detailed Steps
Initialization

The NFC_echo class initializes the NFC reader using nfc.ContactlessFrontend('usb') and sets up a list to store the captured data.
Sniffing

The sniff method connects to the NFC frontend and waits for an NFC device to be detected. When an NFC device is detected, the on_card_connect method reads the data from the device and stores it in the sniffed_data list.
Replaying

The replay method replays the captured data stored in the sniffed_data list. Currently, it prints the data to the console. Implement the actual replay logic based on your NFC hardware capabilities.

Notes

    Ensure your NFC reader is compatible with nfcpy and connected properly.
    Be aware of legal and ethical considerations when handling NFC data, especially sensitive information like bank cards. Use this tool responsibly.
